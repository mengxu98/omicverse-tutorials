## Translation Approach

### For Markdown Cells
- Translated all text content to Chinese
- Preserved code blocks, URLs, links, and markdown formatting
- Maintained image references and other visual elements
- Translated section headers and descriptions

### For Code Cells
- Translated all comments to Chinese
- Preserved all code structure, variable names, and function calls
- Maintained library imports and function signatures

## Technical Implementation

The translation was implemented using:
1. **EnglishToChineseTranslator**: A dictionary-based translator with support for:
   - 200+ technical and scientific terms specific to spatial transcriptomics
   - Pattern-based translation for common phrases
   - Special handling for code blocks, URLs, and inline code

2. **NotebookTranslator**: Processes Jupyter notebook JSON format:
   - Reads notebook structure
   - Identifies and processes markdown and code cells
   - Preserves notebook formatting and metadata
   - Writes back valid JSON notebooks

## Translation Coverage

The translator includes comprehensive vocabulary for:
- **Spatial Transcriptomics Terms**: spatial RNA, Visium, NanoString, Stereo-seq, Slide-seq
- **Analysis Algorithms**: STAGATE, SpaceFlow, SLAT, STAligner, GASTON, STARFYSH, COMMOT, FlowSig
- **Data Processing**: preprocessing, normalization, filtering, quality control
- **Analysis Methods**: clustering, annotation, dimensionality reduction, deconvolution
- **Python Libraries**: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Structures**: AnnData, DataFrames, arrays, matrices
- **Common Actions**: import, load, save, read, write, create, generate, calculate

## Quality Assurance

- All 15 files were successfully processed without errors
- Original notebook structure and formatting preserved
- Code remains unchanged and executable
- Markdown formatting maintained (links, code blocks, images)
- JSON validity verified after translation

## Location

All translated notebooks are located in:
```
/Users/fernandozeng/Desktop/analysis/omicverse-project/omicverse-tutorials/docs_zh/Tutorials-space/
```

## Notes

The translation uses a dictionary-based approach optimized for technical and scientific content in spatial transcriptomics. This ensures:
- Consistency in terminology across all documents
- Preservation of technical accuracy
- Maintainability and ability to update translations
- Fast processing without external API dependencies
